# OAUTH2
# Set to `true` to use OpenID/OAuth2 authentication via the
# traefik-forward-auth service in d.rymcg.tech.
# Using OpenID/OAuth2 will require login to access your app,
# but it will not affect what a successfully logged-in person can do in your
# app. If your app has built-in authentication and can check the user
# header that traefik-forward-auth sends, then your app can limit what the
# logged-in person can do in the app. But if your app can't check the user
# header, or if your app doesn't have built-in authentication at all, then
# any person with an account on your Forgejo server can log into your app and
# have full access.
ACTUAL_OAUTH2=false
# In addition to Oauth2 authentication, you can configure basic authorization
# by entering which authorization group can log into your app. You create
# groups of email addresses in the `traefik` folder by running `make groups`.

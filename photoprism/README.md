# photoprism

[PhotoPrismÂ®](https://hub.docker.com/r/photoprism/photoprism) is an
AI-Powered Photos App for the Decentralized Web.

## Config

```
make config
```

This will ask you to enter the domain name to use.
It automatically saves your responses into the configuration file
`.env_{INSTANCE}`.

You'll also be prompted to enter a few configurations for PhotoPrism,
but there are other Photoprism options you can configure by manually
editing your `.env_{DOCKER_CONTEXT}` file. If you add more media volumes,
be sure to add them to `docker-compose.yaml` as well; and if you add an
import volume, be sure to uncomment the corresponding line in the 
`photoprism` service in `docker-compose.yaml` as well.

### Authentication and Authorization

See [AUTH.md](../AUTH.md) for information on adding external authentication on
top of your app.

## Install

```
make install
```

## Open

```
make open
```

This will automatically open the page in your web browser, and will
prefill the HTTP Basic Authentication password if you enabled it (and chose
to store it in `passwords.json`).

Photoprism also has it's own authentication, and the initial password for
the "admin" account (whatever you entered for `PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_USER`)
is "password". You should change this from within Photoprism.

## Destroy

```
make destroy
```

This completely removes the container (and would also delete all its
volumes).

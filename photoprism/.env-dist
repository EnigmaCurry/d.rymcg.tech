## The following can be named docker volumes OR host mounted absolute paths.
## Make sure to create these directories before install.
##
## Where to store your original media files:
PHOTOPRISM_ORIGINALS_VOLUME=/tmp/images
##
## Optionally, you can add additional media volumes, but be sure to also add
## them to the `photoprism` service in `docker-compose.yaml` as well.
## Example:
# PHOTOPRISM_HOST_MEDIA_VOLUME_2=/tmp/more-images
# PHOTOPRISM_CONTAINER_MEDIA_DIR_2=more-images
##
## Optionally, you can add a base folder from which files can be imported
## to originals, but be sure to uncomment the corresponding line in the 
## `photoprism` service in `docker-compose.yaml` as well.
# PHOTOPRISM_HOST_IMPORT_VOLUME=/tmp/import

## Traefik htpasswd encoded authentication
## (automatically set via `make config`):

## Traefik IP whitelist filter to block access to the client interface:

# OAUTH2
# Set to `true` to use OpenID/OAuth2 authentication via the
# traefik-forward-auth service in d.rymcg.tech.
# Using OpenID/OAuth2 will require login to access your app,
# but it will not affect what a successfully logged-in person can do in your
# app. If your app has built-in authentication and can check the user
# header that traefik-forward-auth sends, then your app can limit what the
# logged-in person can do in the app. But if your app can't check the user
# header, or if your app doesn't have built-in authentication at all, then
# any person with an account on your Forgejo server can log into your app and
# have full access.
COPYPARTY_OAUTH2=false
# In addition to Oauth2 authentication, you can configure basic authorization
# by entering which authorization group can log into your app. You create
# groups of email addresses in the `traefik` folder by running `make groups`.

# Mutual TLS (mTLS):
# Set true or false. If true, all clients must present a certificate signed by Step-CA:

# Enter a comma separated list of client domains allowed to connect via mTLS.

## Set the Copyparty Edition you want to build an image for:
##    min (57 MiB, 20 gz) is just copyparty itself
##    im (70 MiB, 25 gz) can thumbnail images with pillow, parse media files with mutagen
##    ac (163 MiB, 56 gz) is im plus ffmpeg for video/audio thumbs + audio transcoding + better tags
##    iv (211 MiB, 73 gz) is ac plus vips for faster heif / avic / jxl thumbnails
##    dj (309 MiB, 104 gz) is iv plus beatroot/keyfinder to detect musical keys and bpm
## ac is recommended since the additional features available in iv and dj are rarely useful

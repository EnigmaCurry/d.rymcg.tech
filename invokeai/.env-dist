# OAUTH2
# Set to `true` to use OpenID/OAuth2 authentication via the
# traefik-forward-auth service in d.rymcg.tech.
# Using OpenID/OAuth2 will require login to access your app,
# but it will not affect what a successfully logged-in person can do in your
# app. If your app has built-in authentication and can check the user
# header that traefik-forward-auth sends, then your app can limit what the
# logged-in person can do in the app. But if your app can't check the user
# header, or if your app doesn't have built-in authentication at all, then
# any person with an account on your Forgejo server can log into your app and
# have full access.
INVOKEAI_OAUTH2=false
# In addition to Oauth2 authentication, you can configure basic authorization
# by entering which authorization group can log into your app. You create
# groups of email addresses in the `traefik` folder by running `make groups`.

# Set true or false. If true, all clients must present a certificate signed by Step-CA:

## INVOKEAI_ROOT is the absolute path *on the host system* where
## Invoke will store its data. It is mounted into the container and
## allows both containerized and non-containerized usage of Invoke.
## d.rymcg.tech doesn't use INVOKEAI_ROOT.
#INVOKEAI_ROOT=~/invokeai

## HOST_INVOKEAI_ROOT and CONTAINER_INVOKEAI_ROOT can be used to
## control the on-host and in-container paths separately.
## HOST_INVOKEAI_ROOT is the path on the docker host's filesystem
## where Invoke will store data, including models. It should be an
## absolute path (if it's a relative path, it will be relative to the
## docker directory in which the docker-compose.yml file is located,
## but that path will be created on the host, which is confusing).
## CONTAINER_INVOKEAI_ROOT is the path within the container where
## Invoke will expect to find the runtime directory. It MUST be an
## absolute path.
INVOKEAI_HOST_INVOKEAI_ROOT=~/invokeai
INVOKEAI_CONTAINER_INVOKEAI_ROOT=/invokeai

## GPU_DRIVER can be set to either `cuda` or `rocm` to enable GPU
## support in the container accordingly.
INVOKEAI_GPU_DRIVER=cuda

## If you are using ROCm for an AMD GPU, you will need to ensure that
## the "render" group within the container and the host system use the
## same group ID. Running `make config` will automatically `ssh` into
## the current Docker context (i.e., the host), determine the GID of
## the "render" group, and add it to your configuration. If you want
## to determine it manually, you can run `make get-render-gid` from
## this directory, or you can manually run `getent group render` on
## the host and note the GID number.
INVOKEAI_RENDER_GROUP_ID=

## CONTAINER_UID can be set to the UID of the user on the host system
## that should own the files in the container. It is usually not
## necessary to change this. Use `id -u` on the host system to find
## the UID.
# CONTAINER_UID=1000

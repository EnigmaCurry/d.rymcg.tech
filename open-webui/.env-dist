# Don't add "-rocm" to the tag - the installer will do that
# automatically if you're installing for a ROCm environment
# (e.g., use "ollama/ollama:0.11.10", not "ollama/ollama:0.11.10-rocm").
#
# Also, one possible tag is just "rocm", which is the latest tag for
# ROCm environments; don't use the "rocm" tag, as this installer will
# add "-rocm" to it, which will not work. The goal here is to force
# pinning a version.

# Set to `true` to use OpenID/OAuth2 authentication via the

# Using OpenID/OAuth2 will require login to access your app,
# but it will not affect what a successfully logged-in person can do in your
# app. If your app has built-in authentication and can check the user
# header that traefik-forward-auth sends, then your app can limit what the
# logged-in person can do in the app. But if your app can't check the user
# header, or if your app doesn't have built-in authentication at all, then
# any person with an account on your Forgejo server can log into your app and
# have full access.

# Don't add "-rocm" to the tag - the installer will do that
# automatically if you're installing for a ROCm environment
# (e.g., use "ollama/ollama:0.11.10", not "ollama/ollama:0.11.10-rocm").
#
# Also, one possible tag is just "rocm", which is the latest tag for
# ROCm environments; don't use the "rocm" tag, as this installer will
# add "-rocm" to it, which will not work. The goal here is to force
# pinning a version.

# OAUTH2
# Set to `true` to use OpenID/OAuth2 authentication via the
# traefik-forward-auth service in d.rymcg.tech.
# Using OpenID/OAuth2 will require login to access your app,
# but it will not affect what a successfully logged-in person can do in your
# app. If your app has built-in authentication and can check the user
# header that traefik-forward-auth sends, then your app can limit what the
# logged-in person can do in the app. But if your app can't check the user
# header, or if your app doesn't have built-in authentication at all, then
# any person with an account on your Forgejo server can log into your app and
# have full access.
OPENWEBUI_OAUTH2=false
# In addition to Oauth2 authentication, you can configure basic authorization
# by entering which authorization group can log into your app. You create

## Cache Control:
##   See https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/env-configuration#cache-settings
## The following default will disable the cache:
#OPENWEBUI_CACHE_CONTROL=no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
## We turn off the cache for this scenario:
##  - Sign in
##  - Log out
##  - Close tab
##  - Open new tab to the open-webui
##  - Be presented with error: "Open WebUI Backend Required"
##    (this is actually a cached error, not a real error!)
##  - Refresh the page and notice that you are redirected back to proper login screen.
## Disabling the cache prevents this scenario! But at the cost of no cache at all :(

## If you want to create your own custom CSS to modify Open-WebUI's

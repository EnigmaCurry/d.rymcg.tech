# OAUTH2
# Set to `yes` to use OpenID/OAuth2 authentication via the
# traefik-forward-auth service in d.rymcg.tech.
# Using OpenID/OAuth2 will require login to access your app,
# but it will not affect what a successfully logged-in person can do in your
# app. If your app has built-in authentication and can check the user
# header that traefik-forward-auth sends, then your app can limit what the
# logged-in person can do in the app. But if your app can't check the user
# header, or if your app doesn't have built-in authentication at all, then
# any person with an account on your Gitea server can log into your app and
# have full access.
WORDPRESS_OAUTH2=no
# With Oauth2 authentication, you can configure which email address(es) can
# log into your app. Email addresses must match those of accounts on your
# Gitea instance. For example, if you have accounts on your Gitea instance
# for alice@example.com and bob@demo.com, and you only want Alice to be able
# to access this app, only enter `alice@example.com` for WORDPRESS_AUTHORIZED_IDENTITIES.

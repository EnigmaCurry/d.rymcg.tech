# d.rymcg.tech templates

This directory contains project templates to be used with the
`d.rymcg.tech create` script, [as described in the root
README](https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/d.rymcg.tech#using-the-drymcgtech-cli-script-optional).

The following is an example of how to create a new project directory,
using any one of these templates. This example creates a project based
off the [whoami](whoami) template, but you can replace the name with
any of the available templates (eg. [python-flask](python-flask)).

```
## Run this from any directory to create a new project directory:
## whoami-test-1 is the new project name. whoami is the name of the template.
d.rymcg.tech create whoami-test-1 whoami

## Go into the new project directory:
cd whoami-test-1
```

Follow the specific instructions found in the `README.md` of your new
project directory.

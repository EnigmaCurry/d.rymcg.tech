# HTTP Basic Authentication:
# Use `make config` to fill this in properly, or set this to blank to disable.
TRILIUMNEXT_NOTES_HTTP_AUTH=

# OAUTH2
# Set to `true` to use OpenID/OAuth2 authentication via the
# traefik-forward-auth service in d.rymcg.tech.
# Using OpenID/OAuth2 will require login to access your app,
# but it will not affect what a successfully logged-in person can do in your
# app. If your app has built-in authentication and can check the user
# header that traefik-forward-auth sends, then your app can limit what the
# logged-in person can do in the app. But if your app can't check the user
# header, or if your app doesn't have built-in authentication at all, then
# any person with an account on your Gitea server can log into your app and
# have full access.
TRILIUMNEXT_NOTES_OAUTH2=
# In addition to Oauth2 authentication, you can configure basic authorization
# by entering which authorization group can log into your app. You create
# groups of email addresses in the `traefik` folder by running `make groups`.

# Mutual TLS (mTLS):
# Set true or false. If true, all clients must present a certificate signed by Step-CA:

# Enter a comma separated list of client domains allowed to connect via mTLS.
# Wildcards are allowed and encouraged on a per-app basis:

# Set to "false" if TriliumNext Notes is not behind a reverse proxy, or set to a
# comma-separated list of trusted reverse proxy IPs.
#   - CIDR notation is permitted, e.g.,: 10.13.16.0/24
#   - expressjs shortcuts are supported, e.g.,: loopback(127.0.0.1/8, ::1/128),
#     linklocal(169.254.0.0/16, fe80::/10), uniquelocal(10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12,
#     192.168.0.0/16, fc00::/7)
# Alternatively, "true" will make use of the leftmost IP in the X-Forwarded-For
# header, or an integer can be used to tell about the number of hops between
# Trilium (which is hop 0) and the first trusted reverse proxy.

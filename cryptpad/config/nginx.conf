    # Privileged computation such as key management is handled in this scope
    # UI content is loaded via the `sandbox_domain`.
    # "Content Security Policy" headers prevent content loaded via the sandbox
    # from accessing privileged information.
    # These variables must be different to take advantage of CryptPad's sandboxing techniques.
    # In the event of an XSS vulnerability in CryptPad's front-end code
    # this will limit the amount of information accessible to attackers.

    # in order for CryptPad to work as expected.

    # if you find that a single machine cannot handle all of your users.
    # If you don't use dedicated domains, this can be the same as $main_domain
    # If you do, they can be added as exceptions to any rules which block connections to remote domains.

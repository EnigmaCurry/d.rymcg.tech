/*  DISCLAIMER:

    There are two recommended methods of running a CryptPad instance:

    1. Using a standalone nodejs server without HTTPS (suitable for local development)
    2. Using NGINX to serve static assets and to handle HTTPS for API server's websocket traffic

    We do not officially recommend or support Apache, Docker, Kubernetes, Traefik, or any other configuration.
    Support requests for such setups should be directed to their authors.

    If you're having difficulty difficulty configuring your instance
    we suggest that you join the project's IRC/Matrix channel.

    If you don't have any difficulty configuring your instance and you'd like to
    support us for the work that went into making it pain-free we are quite happy
    to accept donations via our opencollective page: https://opencollective.com/cryptpad

/*  CryptPad is designed to serve its content over two domains.
 *  Account passwords and cryptographic content is handled on the 'main' domain,
 *  while the user interface is loaded on a 'sandbox' domain
 *  which can only access information which the main domain willingly shares.
 *
 *  In the event of an XSS vulnerability in the UI (that's bad)
 *  this system prevents attackers from gaining access to your account (that's good).
 *
 *  Most problems with new instances are related to this system blocking access
 *  because of incorrectly configured sandboxes. If you only see a white screen
 *  when you try to load CryptPad, this is probably the cause.
 *
 *  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS CAREFULLY.

/*  httpUnsafeOrigin is the URL that clients will enter to load your instance.
 *  Any other URL that somehow points to your instance is supposed to be blocked.
 *  The default provided below assumes you are loading CryptPad from a server
 *  which is running on the same machine, using port 3000.
 *
 *  In a production instance this should be available ONLY over HTTPS
 *  using the default port for HTTPS (443) ie. https://cryptpad.fr
 *  In such a case this should be also handled by NGINX, as documented in
 *  cryptpad/docs/example.nginx.conf (see the $main_domain variable)
 *
 *  Note: you may provide multiple origins for the purpose of accessing
 *  a development instance via different URLs, like so:
 *  httpUnsafeOrigin: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/ http://localhost:3000/',
 *
 *  Such configuration is not recommended for production instances,

 *
 *  This is not appropriate in a production environment where invasive networks
 *  may filter traffic going over abnormal ports.
 *  To correctly configure your production instance you must provide a URL
 *  with a different domain (a subdomain is sufficient).
 *  It will be used to load the UI in our 'sandbox' system.

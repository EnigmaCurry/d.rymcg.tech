# CryptPad is designed to serve its content over two domains. Account
# passwords and cryptographic content is handled on the 'main' domain,
# while the user interface is loaded on a 'sandbox' domain which can only
# access information which the main domain willingly shares.
CPAD_MAIN_DOMAIN=pad.example.com
CPAD_SANDBOX_DOMAIN=pad.box.example.com
# Choose Let's Encrypt 'staging' or 'production' environment:

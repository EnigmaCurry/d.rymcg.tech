# Mosquitto
[Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) is an MQTT pub/sub message broker. 


You can use it in combination with [node-red](../nodered) to create easy task
automation pipelines.

You can use it in combination with [minio](../minio) to respond to S3 bucket
events (lambda)

 * [MQTT â€“ How to use ACLs and multiple user accounts](https://blog.jaimyn.dev/mqtt-use-acls-multiple-user-accounts/)

## Config

Run `make config` or copy `.env-dist` to `.env`, and edit variables accordingly.

The `admin` password will be printed to the terminal. 

You can add additional users and print their passwords: 

```
make user
```

List all the user accounts:

```

```

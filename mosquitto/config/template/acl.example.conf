## Example ACL rules:
## This file is entirely commented out and unused.
## You need to create per-context ACL in ./context/CONTEXT_NAME/acl.conf

### The difference between 'topic' and 'pattern':
## topic is a static rule for a given topic or topic glob (topic/#, topic/+) 
## pattern is a rule for a dynamic pattern matching name with %c or $u.
## %c and %u both matches the client's TLS CN or username (they are equivalent).

# # allow any authenticated user to read/write to topic "test":
# # and all of its subtopics (e.g., test/foo):
# topic readwrite test/#

# # allow any authenticated user to read/write to a topics with their own name:
# pattern readwrite user/%u/#
# # only allow other users read access to user topics:
# topic read user/+/#

# # ============================
# # 1. Default access for all users (optional)
# # ============================

# # Allow all authenticated users to subscribe/publish to all topics
# pattern readwrite #

# # Allow all authenticated users to read/write within a specific topic hierarchy
# pattern readwrite home/+

# # ============================
# # 2. Specific user-based access
# # ============================

# # Allow user 'client1' to read and write to a specific topic
# user client1
# topic readwrite sensors/temperature
# topic readwrite devices/doorbell

# # Allow user 'client2' to read-only from a topic
# user client2
# topic read sensors/humidity

# # Allow user 'client3' to write-only to a topic
# user client3
# topic write logs/events

# # Deny access to a specific user by not defining any rules
# user blocked_user

# # ============================
# # 3. Wildcard-based permissions
# # ============================

# # Allow all users to subscribe to topics under 'public/#'
# topic read public/#

# # Allow all users to publish to 'write-only/' hierarchy
# topic write write-only/#

# # Allow all users to read sensor data under 'sensors/+' (only one level)
# topic read sensors/+

# # ============================
# # 4. Pattern-based dynamic access
# # ============================

# # Allow users to read/write their own topics based on their username
# pattern readwrite user/%u/#

# # Allow users to only publish to topics matching their username
# pattern write user/%u/data

# # Allow specific clients to access topics based on certificate CN
# pattern readwrite clients/%c/#

# # ============================
# # 5. Restricting anonymous access (if enabled in mosquitto.conf)
# # ============================

# # Allow anonymous users to only read public announcements
# user anonymous
# topic read public/announcements

# # ============================
# # 6. Access to specific system topics
# # ============================

# # Allow only specific users to subscribe to broker monitoring topics
# user admin
# topic read $SYS/#

# # ============================
# # 7. Deny access explicitly (by not including a topic)
# # ============================

# # If a user is not listed in the ACL, they will have no access by default.
# # Remove the following line to restrict all access when an ACL file is specified:
# topic readwrite #

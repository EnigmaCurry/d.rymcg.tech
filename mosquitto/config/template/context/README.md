Create sub-directories here for each Docker context. Create a file
named `acl.conf` in each sub-directory to configure the ACL per
context.

For example, if your Docker context is named `foo`, create the file
`./foo/acl.conf`.

All files placed in this directory are ignored by git.

See [../acl.example.conf](../acl.example.conf)

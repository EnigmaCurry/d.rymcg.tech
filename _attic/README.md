Here are things are no longer supported, could be broken, but at least
they all worked at one point in time or the other, and could be fixed
up and moved back to the root directory with a bit of love and care.

Caveat Emptor!


* [Mailu](mailu) - an email service suite. Run a private mail server connected to a public relay host.
* [transmission-wireguard](transmission-wireguard) - an older but very popular Bittorrent (v1) client with a combined VPN client
* [CryptPad](cryptpad) - a collaborative document and spreadsheet editor stuck on an old unsupported version.

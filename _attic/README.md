# Attic

Things living in the _attic directory are applications that are no longer
supported, and might be broken, but at least they all worked at one
point in time or the other. With a bit of love and care these could be
fixed up, and moved back into the root directory.

Caveat Emptor!

* [Mailu](mailu) - an email service suite. Run a private mail server connected to a public relay host.
* [transmission-wireguard](transmission-wireguard) - an older but very popular Bittorrent (v1) client with a combined VPN client
* [CryptPad](cryptpad) - a collaborative document and spreadsheet editor stuck on an old unsupported version.

# Attic

Things living in the _attic directory are applications that are no longer
supported, and might be broken, but at least they all worked at one
point in time or the other. With a bit of love and care these could be
fixed up, and moved back into the root directory.

Caveat Emptor!

* [Mailu](mailu) - an email service suite. Run a private mail server connected to a public relay host.
* [transmission-wireguard](transmission-wireguard) - an older but very popular Bittorrent (v1) client with a combined VPN client
* [CryptPad](cryptpad) - a collaborative document and spreadsheet editor stuck on an old unsupported version.
* [TiddlyWiki (WebDAV version)](tiddlywiki-webdav#readme) - a personal wiki stored in a single static HTML file
* [TiddlyWiki (NodeJS version)](tiddlywiki-nodejs#readme) - Advanced server edition of TiddlyWiki with image CDN
* [Wireguard layer4 proxy](wireguard#readme) - This old wireguard config has been usurped by the traefik config.

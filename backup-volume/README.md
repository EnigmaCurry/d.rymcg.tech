# Backup

[docker-volume-backup](https://offen.github.io/docker-volume-backup/)
is a lightweight backup solution for Docker volumes. It can backup and
upload your archives to an offsite S3 storage provider. It can
coordinate automatic shutdown of containers before backups take place
and restarting them after the backup is done.

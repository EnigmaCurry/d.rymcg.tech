# Air 66 Design YOURLS Admin Theme

[![Air 66 Design logo](screenshots/A66-Logo.png)](https://air66design.com)

This is a responsive admin theme for use with [YOURLS](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS), a self hosted set of PHP scripts that let you run your own URL shortener.

The theme includes a slide in off page navigation, fixed below the nav url shortener on laptop and desktop and a relative postioned url shortener on mobile.

The tables and graphs have a horizontal scroll on mobile when the viewport becomes too small.
